Hi, Iâ€™m Quige... Welcome to my repository! I have a lot of caughing up to do. I have not really done much programing for the past decade!
I leard how to pragram C++ what now what seems like the darkages.  1993 does not seem that long along to me. But that was almost 30 years ago!
I still remember the "fun" I had spendeing endles hours searching for what made the complier split out an error code. 
The compiler did list at what line the error occurd.  But that was never really the place place at all.  Only if it were that simple!
9 out of 10 times it was those dam brackets!  My nemesis! Those fucking things! To this day I refuse to even use them. { } = evil
I mean programimg to me was open a notepad text file and just start typing. #include <> int main() {  And go from there.
Using a vt100 terminal with a green or amber monitor.  Hey! It was all new to me..  That same Freshman year in collage a Beta shareware was being past around. 
MOSAIC Browser.
I have the image burtn in my brain of the Godzila looking figure in the top left corner of the screen move back and forth like it was roaring.
It meant the website was loading.  With my state of the art 33.3K Modem, it only took 2 or 3 minutes to load each page!
Well we had pictures now thart was a big deal.  No more all text news groups. This was 2 years before Microsft realeased Windows 95!
