Hi, I'm Quige... Welcome to my repository!  I have a lot of catching up to do.  I have not done much programming for the past decade!
I learned how to program C++ what now seems like the dark ages.  1993 does not seem to be that long along to me.  But that was almost 30 years ago!
I still remember the "fun" I had spending endless hours searching for what made the compiler spit out an error code.  The compiler did list at what line the error occurred.
But that was never really the place at all.  Only if it were that simple! 9 out of 10 times, it was those dam brackets!  My nemesis!  Those fucking things! 
To this day, I refuse even to use them. 
{ } = evil 
I mean programming to me was opening a notepad text file and starting typing.
 #include <stdio.h> 
int main() 
{ 
And go from here!
}
With today's editors, it is a snap!  The color scheme is incredible!   I mean hell… I was using a VT100 terminal with a green or amber monitor.
Hey!  It was all new to me... That same Freshman year in college, a beta shareware was being passed around.  It was the MOSAIC Browser. 
I have the image burnt in my brain of the Godzilla-looking figure in the top left corner of the screen moving back and forth like it was roaring.
It meant the website was loading.  With my state-of-the-art 33.3K Modem, it only took 2 or 3 minutes to load each page!  
Well, we had pictures now that was a big deal!  No more all text newsgroups. .alt --> Goodbye! We have visual pages now! This was two years before Microsft released Windows 95!  
DOS was fun… Unix… not so much!  Long story about that one.  Have youu ever seem the 80's movie War Games?  Startng Matthew Broderick? 
Something like that.. Just not as exciting!!
